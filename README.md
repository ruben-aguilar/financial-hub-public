# Financial Hub

A lightweight personal finance dashboard for exploring transactions, category spending, and trends. It is built with Vite, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## Development

Install dependencies and start the dev server:

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open the local URL shown by Vite (default: http://localhost:8080).

## Add New Movements (CSV)

1. Drop a new CSV file into `src/movements/`.
2. Run the parser to rebuild `src/config/transactions.json`:

```sh
npm run parse-transactions
```

The app reads transactions from `src/config/transactions.ts`, which loads the JSON generated by the parser.
